## Applied Data Analysis 01/23 notes

**import data from file \<data-wrangling.csv\>**

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
f <- file.choose()
typeof(f)
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)

```

**view data structure and specific lines**

```{r}

View(d)
glimpse(d)
class(d) #different types of data in "d"
head(d)
tail(d)

```

**using \$ to extract data**

```{r}
fbm <- d$Body_mass_female_mean
bs <- d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean
```

**\$ and \[\[ \]\] have the same function**

```{r}

fbm_1 <- d[["Body_mass_female_mean"]]
bs_1 <- d[["Brain_Size_Species_Mean"]]
```

**plot the relationship between female body mass and brain size**

```{r}

plot(fbm, bs)
plot(log(fbm), log(bs))
```

**generate new column using two extant columns**

```{r}

speciesname <- paste(d$Genus, d$Species) #with space between the words
speciesname <- paste0(d$Genus, d$Species) #without space between the words
speciesname <- paste(d$Genus, d$Species, sep = "_") #add "_" between the words
```
